It really leaves it up to the viewer paint their own narrative with the context clues laid out in the story!\u201d<br />\r\nItchio<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cThis was a really nice read. I didn't know what to expect from it, but after getting what I think was all the endings it came full circle.\u201d<br />\r\nitchio<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cWow, fantastic art! Makes me want to leave my job, pull a Stardew Valley, and move to the countryside right away. :)  Of course, the peaceful opening tone makes... the twist that much more radical and gripping.  I am ambivalent about the choice to speak about the player character in the third person. Most games would say &quot;I&quot; or &quot;you.&quot; Saying &quot;The Farmer&quot; puts a little distance between the player and the player character.\u201d<br />\r\nitchio<br />\r\n",
