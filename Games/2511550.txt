Introducing <strong>Voice Quest</strong>, a 3D platformer experience that defies the norms and redefines interaction with your character.<br><br>In this quirky, whimsical realm, you don't simply control the character; you become <i>Shadow Man</i>. Your voice is your ally, guiding you through a world fraught with challenges and rib-tickling humor. Command your movements with the power of speech, from a gentle walk to a swift run, a daring jump, or even a moment of silence to regroup. Direct your path by aiming your gaze, using either your trusty mouse or controller.<br><br>Your journey will be riddled with delectable bananas to collect and nefarious strawberry monsters to dodge. These strawberries are not your ordinary garden-variety pests; they are the evil incarnate, determined to halt your progress. Each level scales in complexity, challenging your dexterity and strategic thinking, all while a giant skull delivers a constant stream of wisecracks at your expense.<br><br>The dynamic music score serves as the heartbeat of the game, adapting to your progression through each level and syncing in harmony with the in-game time. As you ascend through the levels, so does the rhythm of your adventure, creating an immersive experience that keeps you on your toes (and your vocal cords)!<br><br>But fear not, dear players, for this is not a tale of solitary heroism.
