options: STREAMER MODE, FADE TO BLACK, and FIVE ALARM CHILI. Streamer Mode will censor ANY sex acts, sexual jokes, and obscene references from the game. Fade to Black will censor all sex acts and nudity. FIVE ALARM CHILI will leave everything uncensored. These settings can be selected at character creation and changed at any time.\r\n\r\nThis game contains a TOGGLEABLE OPTION to turn sex-based minigames and nudity on or off. These minigames include narrative-based and realistic sex acts, including but not limited to: full penetration, oral sex, BDSM, consensual acts of roleplayed nonconsent if the player selects this option explicitly, consensual acts of stalking, and supernatural possession. All acts WILL ASK FOR IN-GAME CONSENT via the course of normal gameplay before unlocking this content and can be turned on/off at any time in the Settings menu.\r\n\r\nAll potentially triggering content (here including suicidal mentions, mentions of parental alcohol abuse, and non-sexual slapping) can be adjusted on the game's Settings page. This will remove the content from your game unless unchecked again.\r\n\r\nThis is a game set at a college and contains copious amounts of mentions of drug use and alcohol among adult characters."}, "ratings": {"dejus": {"rating_generated": "1", "rating": "18", "required_age": "18", "banned": "0", "use_age_gate": "0", "descriptors": "Drogas il\u00edcitas\nNudez\nLinguagem impr\u00f3pria"}, "steam_germany": {"rating_generated": "1", "rating": "BANNED", "required_age": "2147483647", "banned": "1", "use_age_gate": "0", "descriptors": "Drogen"}}}
