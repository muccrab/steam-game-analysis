We have to renovate an old military base and create an airport for small planes out of it - and later turn it into an international airport.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Renovate and Develop</h2>Your investor demands rapid progress, but leaves key decisions to you. Demolish walls and add new ones. Pick out decorations and paint the walls your favorite color. Put up modern hangars and create an airplane gas station.

You'll have to fiddle around a bit at first, but a welder in hand can work wonders. A tank with an arm from an excavator? Why not! You will replace each tool with better and faster ones over time. You will replace an ordinary hammer with a jackhammer, and an ordinary saw with a chain one.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2366250/extras/screen_6_850.jpg?t=1710416228\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hire Employees</h2>Your investor requires a quick return on investment, so you need to keep growing the business.

Some are understanding, others are demanding and grouchy. You need to take care of the needs of each of them. If they are satisfied with your services, they will return with their friends.
