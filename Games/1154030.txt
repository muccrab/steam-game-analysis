She is corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including you. Take up your weapon, fight alongside gods, and change fate itself in order to stop Nemesis, free those she\u2019s punished, and weave your own epic tale.<br><br>From the creators of SpellForce 3 comes a handcrafted action RPG for a new generation of mythical heroes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A World of Myth and Monsters</h2> Set out on an adventure worthy of myth that takes you from picturesque beaches, to serene Greek temples, to places where no mortal has ever ventured, including the mysterious realm of the Moirai themselves. Battle classic creatures from Greek myth and the original Titan Quest, including Ichthians, Centaurs, Satyrs, Harpies, Sirens, Gryphons, and many, many more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploration-Focused Campaign</h2>Pay close attention to your surroundings! The world is full of mysteries and secrets to discover. Legendary monsters lurk in hidden groves, and you never know when you will end up face-to-face with a god. Visit memorable towns full of life and intrigue. The conversations you engage in and the items you find along your journey can lead to surprising discoveries, or they might just hold the key to stopping Nemesis. This is your adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Challenge Fit for a Hero</h2>Heroic deeds require heroic effort. The enemies you face are far from defenseless - dodge and counter their attacks, then overwhelm them with a well-timed flurry of blows. Powerful rituals allow you to freely control the game\u2019s difficulty, while deep character customization systems ensure that there\u2019s always a good reason to replay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Flexible character system: In Titan Quest 2, you are in control of your own fate. Customize your hero, then form your own class by combining two masteries. Build your character around the strengths and weakness of both masteries, exploring different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items to create your own hybrid class and find your favorite playstyle. Grow your powers from those of a young mortal to a hero to rival the gods themselves!<br><br></li><li>Meaningful loot: Every item serves a function, and every character class has many options when it comes to finding the perfect equipment. Even the most common spear can be upgraded via affix crafting, and with the right ingredients, you may even forge it into a unique item spoken of only in legend!<br><br></li><li>Challenging action RPG combat: Enemies form factions and work together, combining their unique skills and abilities to keep you on your toes. Use the deep character build system and access every skill at your disposal to vanquish them in this unique action RPG experience.<br><br></li><li>A beautiful, handcrafted world rooted in Greek myth: Encounter stunning vistas and deep caverns, and traverse the world with your divine mount, Areion. Use the powers of the gods to uncover secret locations and explore lovingly designed levels full of verticality.<br><br></li><li>Online multiplayer: Join up with friends to take on the Goddess of Retribution. Like Jason and the Argonauts, sometimes you need a group of heroes for your journey.<br><br></li><li>Rich and immersive sound: An atmospheric soundtrack blends traditional Greek music with modern orchestral elements to create epic, memorable themes, drawing you into Titan Quest 2's unique world.</li></ul>", "about_the_game": "Return to the classic mythology-inspired setting of Titan Quest and go toe-to-toe with legendary monsters as you journey across a fantastical reimagining of ancient Greece.<br><br>Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution, is out of control.
