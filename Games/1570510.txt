After all, the 'crawler doesn't feature visceral action or jump scares. It's all too turn-based for that. But, of course, horror can be much more than jump scares and visceral action, and Undernauts demonstrates that beautifully. Strong atmosphere, challenging combat and Experience Inc.'s mastery of the genre combine to create something that is nearly impossible to put down.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitallydownloaded.net%2F2021%2F10%2Freview-undernauts-labyrinth-of-yomi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >Digitally Downloaded</a><br><br>\u201cI get asked a lot which game I recommend for people wanting to get into Wizardry-likes. And until now I didn\u2019t have a good answer; everything was a series of compromises and required me to lay out caveats or provide upfront guidance. What Experience, Inc has done with Undernauts is finally make a satisfying DRPG that looks good, plays well, and I can unequivocally say is where people new to the genre can get a taste of the richer, weirder treasures below.\u201d<br>8.5/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pastemagazine.com%2Fgames%2Fundernauts%2Fundernauts-game-review%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >Paste Magazine</a><br><br>\u201cUndernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi might be the best dungeon-crawling RPG from Experience yet.
