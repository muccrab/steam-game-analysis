It's classic pixel art, with a focus on interesting designs for the player-controlled characters and the many cool moves they can execute. It is nice to watch the action unfold but the variety of locations and enemies is limited. More energy has been used to create bosses and their unique moves. The interface is easy to navigate and offers plenty of information for players to process.\u201d\u201d<br>80 \u2013 <a
