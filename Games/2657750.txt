It's a 2D top-down shooter that redefines the idea of AI enemies. In this game, walls can become your most dangerous enemy. You can't hide behind them, you can't use them to your advantage, and your bullets can't pass through them. Meanwhile, enemies can move freely through the map and they will chase you to your death. No matter how deep you are into the game, one stupid mistake can end your progress abruptly, so be careful and never underestimate your enemies. In addition to this, there's a deep lore behind the game explained in a very easy way, so you don't have to read long texts or memorize multiple names, just enjoy the way everything unravels.<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2657750/extras/FIN_banner_4.png?t=1707896927\" /><br>Enemies are optimized to make your life there miserable. If you think you are fast enough, a new soul will approach you with terrifying speed while dodging your useless bullets. If you think your weapons are strong enough, a new soul will appear in the darkness, coming to you slowly but resisting all your damage. If you think you have everything under control, which you should never do, your surroundings will become the playground of a sneaky soul only visible through your lantern. All of them will tear you apart in seconds, so you better get away from them and think fast. These are not the only enemies there are, so don't get cocky and learn from all their movements.<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2657750/extras/FIN_banner_2.png?t=1707896927\" /><br>The game has two main modes:<br>- <strong>Ego chamber</strong>: If you want to understand the lore of the game, this is where you should go. It can be done in 40 minutes or 100 hours, depending on your skill level. Take into consideration it's very challenging and can become frustrating at times. Each level works as a checkpoint, but be aware of every trick the weird entity tries to pull on you. You can lose all your progress if you are not careful and be forced to start the Ego chamber from the start. The more you advance, the more things you'll understand, and the more challenging enemies will become.<br>- <strong>Survival</strong>: Just to have fun and break scores. Make use of the best weapons, the best strategies, and the best equipment so you can last the most rounds possible. Just try not to break all the lights, you'll miss them on late rounds. You can choose from 2 different maps. Survival Corridor is composed of 27 rounds designed manually to make the experience there frustrating and difficult. You'll need to explore the map in search of better equipment and not get trapped in narrow corridors. Combat Arena on the other hand is very easy to explore, and rounds are randomly generated. If you have the patience and skills to get to round 100, that's a win, but I doubt you are capable of that.<br><br>**************************************************************************<br><br>The game has a very defined and dark sense of humor.
