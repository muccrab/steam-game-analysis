Here you will be faced with numerous challenges. <br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>You will have to survive 5 minutes to complete each Phase. In Paresis you are surrounded by 4 rooms. These rooms will unlock throughout each phase and will have a new unique enemy you must encounter. In Paresis, these enemies are called Morphs and they have their own positives and negatives. For example, one may be faster then another but they will have fewer hiding spots. On the other hand, you, the player, have zero movement and must use your lean and flame energy to survive the phase. However, each phase will become harder and you must undergo new obstacles. Once you complete a phase you will be able to make a choice between faster leaning speeds, or extra energy. Flame energy will scare away the Morphs and leaning helps you locate Morphs faster.<br><br><strong>HARDCORE MODE</strong><br>Hardcore Mode is obtained after you complete Paresis's main Phases. Completing the ending Phases within Paresis's main game can serve as a real challenge even for some of the best gamers. If you do beat the final Phase within Paresis, you will unlock the option to play Hardcore. This adds even more challenge to the existing Phases but also changes up some gameplay elements as well. However, in this mode you will not be able to upgrade your lean speed or energy. This mode is targeted for anyone who wants the hardest challenge possible within a horror game experience.<br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>Paresis has plenty of lore for those interested in the game's story. If you beat a phase, you will be able to listen to radios that can help you understand more of the game's secrets. These radios are extremely important to the game's overall plot. Although, there are plenty of little <strong><i>easter eggs</i></strong> hidden about that also carry more of the game's overarching narrative. However, some things are better left unsaid. <br><br><strong>CHALLENGING</strong><br>Paresis is a very challenging game once you reach some of the ending phases. This will test your listening, logic, and timing skills. In order to beat these phases, you will have to dig deep and figure out what is the best strategy moving forward.
