Types of 1 blocks are represented by color and shape (customizable). Three or more blocks of the same value (and type for 1 blocks) combine to form a new block with a value equal to the sum of the numbers in the combination. Move blocks by swapping two adjacent blocks. Swapping is only allowed if it creates a combination.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Innovative Match-3 Gameplay</h2>Every time blocks are combined to create a larger number, they level up. The higher the level, the large the range that block is allowed to swap with another block to form combinations. This powerful ability gives you more tools in controlling and organizing your board.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect Numbers</h2>Receive achievements for each new number you create. Collecting numbers allows you to unlock new game modes.
