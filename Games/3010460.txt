Be careful because the control room is not safe once the iron door is opened. Even if someone sacrifices themselves, they can escape the room if at least one member of the team reaches the target amount. If the target amount is not met more than 3 times, the main control room will no longer operate and will be closed.<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010460/extras/backroom3.gif?t=1719993168\" /><br><br>Make good use of your walkie-talkie to communicate with your teammates.

Hiding in the locker room is the only way you can survive. And never make a sound when the Parasite appears. You must not make any footsteps or speak. Because they have no eyes and cannot see.
