You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.<br><br>Choose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.<br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/banner_end.png?t=1720059308\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/header_ship_crew_contract_en.png?t=1720059308\" /><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/Topheaderanim.gif?t=1720059308\" /><br>To stay one step ahead of your pursuers you\u2019ll need three things: A belt-worthy ship, a tight crew and a contract or two. <br><br>The ship you stole. It\u2019s a ragged old Rig that\u2019s seen better days, but it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Upgrade your ship to extend its range, reach new locations and turn it from a hovel to a home. <br><br>Your crew starts with Serafin, your fellow escapee and a rock-solid pilot. But you\u2019ll need scrappers, engineers and all sorts to take on the work that\u2019ll keep you flying. From temporary contractors to new residents of the Rig, each of these characters has their own story, skills and troubles. Choose carefully. <br><br>Contracts take place far from the bars and shops of the Belt\u2019s many hubs. These high-risk jobs each have their own challenges. From exploring treacherous derelicts and risky heists, to asteroid surveying and ship repair, you\u2019ll need to make the most of your skills, crew and resources to complete the contract and get paid. <br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/banner_end.png?t=1720059308\" /><br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/malfunction.gif?t=1720059308\" /><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_stay_ahead_of_your_past_en.png?t=1720059308\" /><br>Soon after escaping from your corporate overlords, you fell under the control of a local criminal gang and its leader, Laine.

Instead of living on a single station, you'll chart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_do_the_job_en.png?t=1720059308\" /><br>Contracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You\u2019ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you\u2019ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2442460/extras/subbanner_choose_your_future_en.png?t=1720059308\" /><br>Player choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices.
