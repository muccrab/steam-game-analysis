The fact that I became obsessed with making sure every mouse made it through the obstacle course tells you how addictive this game can be. Of the 80 levels included, there are a few that can stop you in your tracks and put you off from returning, but that minor flaw aside, MouseCraft is a great game that puzzle fans should take a look at.\u201d<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesixthaxis.com%2F2014%2F07%2F08%2Fmousecraft-review-ps4-ps3-vita-pc%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >The Sixth Axis</a><br><br>\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of puzzle games, don\u2019t miss Crunching Koalas\u2019 brilliant remix.
