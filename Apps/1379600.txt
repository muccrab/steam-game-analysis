Your goal is to survive long enough to discover the cure\u2026 or die trying. Humanity\u2019s fate is in your hands! Start your journey now! <br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379600/extras/What_is_pandemic_trainN.gif?t=1707473294\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are in charge!</h2>Pandemic Train is a survival game with roguelike and strategy elements in which you command the crew and passengers aboard an old train powered by a steam engine. The plot takes place in an alternative timeline of the 20th century when a catastrophic virus epidemic decimates the world's population. A mysterious plague kills infected people within 24 hours, leading to widespread panic, riots, and war. The world is in ruins and you are the only hope for its survival. Explore the wastelands, collect resources, fight bandits, and find a cure for a deadly disease!<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379600/extras/You_are_in_chargeN.gif?t=1707473294\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive!</h2>In Pandemic Train the world has become a very inhospitable place. People will die along the way, and you have to minimize the damage. The resources are scarce, so you have to distribute them very carefully. And worst of all - there are lots of hungry wolves around. And by \u2018hungry wolves\u2019 we mean desperate people who will do anything to defeat you and stop your search for the cure. To defeat your opponents, take care of the resources you acquire and produce. They are limited, so use them carefully.

You have to utilize every bit of scrap or junk at your disposal and turn it into something useful. This often leads to difficult decisions, for example - there\u2019s rarely enough medicine for everyone, so you\u2019ll have to decide who is worth the treatment, and who will suffer or even be left to die.<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1379600/extras/Manage_the_resourcesN.gif?t=1707473294\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight the plague!</h2>The main goal of your actions is to create a vaccine and save the remnants of humanity from extinction. The longer you manage to keep the train moving, the less likely that the crew will have contact with the virus, and your scientists will get more time to work on the medication. You can customize the train to your needs - decide how many people are on it and how many train cars are going to be attached to the engine. But remember - the bigger the party, the harder it is to keep it in check. You are the only hope for mankind.
