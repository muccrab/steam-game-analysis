Natural Born Scoundrels explores the rogue path in depth and expands the options available to players who choose it for their characters. Inside this supplement, you will find rules for playing academics, darksouls, and dogmatists, along with all the old favorites. In addition, this entry into the Paths of Shadow series offers up a set of new expert paths designed with the rogue in mind. The tinker can cobble together enchanted objects from spare parts, while the emissary become a powerful agent of the gods. The options revealed in this book are guaranteed to take your rogues into exciting new directions! <br>  <br> <strong> In Pursuit Of Power</strong>  <br> Magicians display the widest range of capabilities of all characters who follow novice paths, thanks to the spells they learn from the magical traditions they discover. One magician might delve into the darkness of Necromancy, creating undead thralls to protect and accompany her on her adventures, while another could pick up a sword and find the magic in it, discovering the Battle tradition to enhance his fighting abilities. <br> Until now, magicians differentiated themselves largely by their spells, but In Pursuit of Power offers them much more flexibility and versatility. Now, magicians can swap out the talents they would gain from their novice path for those related to the traditions they've discovered. As a magician, your talents could reflect your growing mastery of your particular traditions, providing new choices and abilities beyond those available in Shadow. <br> If you have what it takes to learn and wield magic, unleash your newfound potential with In Pursuit of Power! <br>  <br> <strong> Called to Serve</strong>  <br> From the devotees of the Old Faith, who guard against despoilers and destroyers, to the zealous followers of the New God, who see evil and corruption wherever they look, religion comes in many forms. Called to Serve explores the priest path in depth, offering guidance for why one might follow this path and the role one might play serving the gods. As well, this supplement includes a slew of new expert paths so characters can go on serving their gods as they did from the beginning and unlock new talents to better advance the causes for which their gods fight. Whether you're playing a grim priest devoted to the Dark Gods or a pious warrior committed to the New God, this supplement offers a host of new options for fighting the Shadow of the Demon Lord! <br>  <br> <strong> Bred for Battle</strong>  <br> Grizzled veterans of countless campaigns, brutish barbarians spilling out from the hinterlands, peerless champions fighting for a noble cause, or hard-bitten mercenaries who have seen it all: these character concepts describe just a few of the possible types of warriors one might find in Shadow of the Demon Lord games. Although warriors might have many different expressions and stories, they all are exceptionally capable with arms and armor in battle. As their experience grows, so do their durability and dependability. At the outset, warriors distinguish themselves by the weapons they wield and armor they wear, but not until they move onto other paths do they truly come into their own. Until now. <br> Bred for Battle builds on the warrior novice path presented in the main rulebook by providing new customization options for combat-focused characters. These options offer more variety in technique, reflecting the nature of a warrior's training and providing inspiration for future development. As with all Paths of Shadow installments, everything in Bred for Battle is optional, so check with your Game Master before putting these ideas to use. <br>  &quot;", "about_the_game": "&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Paths of Shadow Bundle</h2>   <br> <strong> Natural Born Scoundrels</strong>  <br> Cutthroat killers, confidence artists, daring scouts, and bold adventurers: rogues can be all these and more.
