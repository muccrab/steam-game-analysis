Three energetic alien slimes, Ember, Penny and Lite, are tasked by their commander to travel to Earth in order to learn more about the lifeforms inhabiting the planet, using their species' unique morphing abilities to disguise themselves as girls in order to keep a low profile!  But after their ship crashes after a non-specific captain falls asleep at the wheel - <i>*cough*</i> Ember <i>*cough*</i>  - The trio get split up and stranded on Earth, leading them to each traverse through a variety of level and locations full of platforming, puzzles and combat, meeting a lively cast of friends and foes along the way!<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1380990/extras/Fountain.gif?t=1718126594\" /><br><br>On their journey, each of the girls will make friends with the people and creatures they find on Earth  that they can trust! Friends who will be happy to tag along and help the girls re-unite, fix their ship, and complete their mission, as well as let them copy their forms to gain new abilities along the way! These abilities include a glide to cross large gaps, a pointy shell to keep hazards at bay, magic spells to defend yourself with, and more!<br><br>However, there will also be some people who won't be as hospitable for their alien guests, ranging from angry snails, evil turtle queens, and even undersea pop-stars! These enemies will stop at nothing to make life harder for the squishy slimes, but that won't stop them from simply morphing into their enemies and using their own moves against them in combat! Jump, solve and fight your way across Earth, morph into a wide variety of different forms, people and creatures, gain access to new abilities, re-unite the girls and maybe even complete the mission they were sent to do, if they actually remember!<br><br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1380990/extras/Herb.gif?t=1718126594\" /><br><br>Tracking your progress every step of the way is H.E.R.B, a helpful slime A.I who keeps up-to-date with what's going on over on Earth, and uses the foil collected to fill out his scrapbook, a special book you can fill with foil to unlock goodies, like new outfits, bite-size challenge zones for Herb to play through, extra cutscenes, and more!<br><br>But the adventure doesn't stop there! Complete all 3 challenging sub-goals in a level to collect medals and unlock even more costumes, and maybe gain access to a secret ending that may or may not be there once you collect every single medal!
