In the midst of the tension, an enigmatic incident sends the world into an apocalyptic war.  Nightmarish creatures of unknown origin suddenly begin to appear, plunging the world into terror and chaos. A young American pilot, Ethan, is caught in the middle of it all, as untold horrors break out on the surface of the planet. He will have to battle endless hordes of monsters in his Mobile Armor, a powerful customizable Mech.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single-Player Campaign</h2>See the story through the eyes of an ace pilot. Fight for humanity\u2019s survival through 20 campaign missions, working as a part of the N.A.T.O forces.
