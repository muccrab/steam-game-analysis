In 1996, Robert Chen took his VHS camcorder to the newly condemned local public school to investigate the disappearances of multiple students, including his younger sister. However, shortly after entering the premises, he finds himself lost in a senseless and seemingly infinite maze of halls and classrooms. Discover the contents of the tape he left behind. Explore The Classrooms and discover the various anomalies it contains; from malicious entities to harmless oddities. And remember, it's different every time you play, so your found footage is uniquely yours.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedural World</h2>The world of The Classrooms is fully procedural and different every time you play. Billions of possible layouts and procedural elements ensure a gameplay experience that's always full of surprises.<br><img src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099110/extras/Sequence_02__1_.gif?t=1718478185\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Entities</h2>Watch out for the various entities that reside within the world of The Classrooms.
