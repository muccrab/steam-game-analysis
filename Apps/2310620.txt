Your task is to gather enough coins to progress, but it is not an easy task as enemies roam the environment. Along the way, you may collect letters in the correct order for rewards, and portals may be accessed and utilized to enter otherwise inaccessible areas of the map. It is a lot of fun to hop on conveyor belts and floating platforms and you can shoot spells against your enemies to freeze them in time momentarily. Each of the levels within the game has its own theme and distinct look-and-feel. You must learn to master the Tower of Bats, the Acid Flooding Pyramid with bouncing portals, the Labyrinth of Madness, and other levels to beat the game.
