The classic point-and-click has a wonderful balance between story and puzzles and really won me over after a short time. It's tricky and challenging, but not impossible to solve. It is hard for me to avoid spoliers this time, as there are so many nice and funny moments that make the game really good for me and that I just want to share. 'Mutropolis' is quiet and comical rather than action packed and more detective game than Indiana Jones story. It really manages to surprise and delight with good ideas.

It would be a good idea to have a sequel for Pirita Studio, either in the form of a sequel or a completely new product.
