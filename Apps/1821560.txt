However, during the development, special attention was paid to making the levels as varied as possible so that the game's fun would not be disturbed by repetitive level design. Alternating traps, enemies and puzzles should offer the player a challenge on his way to the last level without getting too frustrated. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, as the game progresses, the player is given more life and magic panpipe melodies to unlock temporary effects. The player can use the melody input to stop time and solve more puzzles, or he can use the melody input to make himself invulnerable for a short time. The player can also place bombs, which he can buy with the diamonds collected in the game. The better the player plays through a level, the more stars he should receive.
