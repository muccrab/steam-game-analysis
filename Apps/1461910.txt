Acquire powerful single use Drops that can shift the tides of battle. Add upgrades to your blueprints to broaden their abilities and enable powerful and surprising combos.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WORLDS OF POSSIBILITIES </h2>Lure the enemy into fog that slows them to a crawl or stun them by blowing up static bushes. Surprise the enemy by attacking in the shroud of a sandstorm or wait for a rainstorm to tackle powerful enemies reliant on burning damage. <br>Discover chests with power-ups. Dig up hidden artifacts to boost your research. Uncover ruins with hidden technologies that might be the key to victory\u2026 or full of unwanted surprises.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ASCEND BEYOND</h2>Keep discovering new builds by unlocking new units, buildings and modificators.<br>The game will keep you challenged.
