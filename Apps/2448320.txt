Bound genies build majestic palaces or guard pompous wizards, while tribes of jann roam the deserts hoping to free all geniekind. Militant factions of Sarenrae's faith rattle their sabers and train dervishes, while mages and scholars from across the world line up to attend Qadira's prestigious academies. And through it all, the war-mongering satrap turns his ambitious eye toward Taldor and the lands to the west, ready to break the centuries-long peace if only the padishah emperor would give him permission. <br> This Pathfinder Companion describes the country of Qadira and its capital of Katheer, the city of a million caravans.
