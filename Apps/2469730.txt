Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Shieldbearer</strong> by Hannah Rose with art from Alejandro Pacheco and Jo?o Phillipe. Smash, bash, and sling your shield all across the battlefield, protecting your allies and wrecking face as a Shieldbearer fighter! This shield-tossing subclass is accompanied by new equipment and magic items, from the trusty boomerang shield to the shield of the shifting moon that cycles through unique features along with the moon's phases. Who needs a plan when you have a shield? <br> <br><strong> Appendix NPC: Part 2</strong> by Sam Mannell with art from Patrik Hell. Even more awesome stat blocks for your NPCs! Sam continues &quot;Appendix NPC&quot; with badass high-level stat blocks for the auto-sentinel (a good good robot friend), the dragon-slayer (definitely handy to have on your side--or, if you're working with dragons, maybe you'll meet a dragon priest), the erudite polymath in their trap-filled lair, and more. <br> <br><strong> The Scribes</strong> by Hook &amp; Chance and The GM Tim with art from Matheus Graef and cartography from Miska Fredman. A mysterious group of Writers who seek to make everyone's lives worthy of an epic tale, the Scribes are a secret organization that can enrich the player characters' own stories as allies, antagonists, or mentors. Putting an entire library in a secret base beneath a lake is pretty audacious and totally epic--just like the Librarian herself. &quot;", "about_the_game": "&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 020 - September 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
