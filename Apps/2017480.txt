There, you will find priests following and receiving powers from deities, mages studying about magic, druids living in communion with nature, elemental spirits protecting the lands and mythological creatures. Legends tell about the Godtouched, rare and powerful races born by the touch of the gods on humans. From time to time, Arganons arise, humans with a mysterious inner energy capable of enhancing physical, mental and spiritual attributes. Forces of chaos and order, good and evil, fight to shape the world into what they believe it should be. <br>\t<strong>Priests </strong>are devout deity-followers with a strong spiritual connection with their god, granting them passive and active powers, the later called Divine Favors. Divine Favors are invocations from the spiritual world. The spiritual connection results from many factors. First, an innate (but trainable) ability to mentally attune with the spiritual world. Second, a personality affinity with the followed god. And third, an ideological affinity with the god. The more the priest is in tune with the god, the easier is to receive divine inspirations and learn Divine Favors, and the more powerful they are.<br>\t<strong>Mages </strong>are bearers of an ethereal substance called Plasma. It is a strongly malleable substance, sensitive to thoughts and feelings. Mages manipulate Plasma trough thoughts and feelings to form spells. This procedure is called magic. Sorcerers do it by focusing on ideas and feelings related to the target spell (Idealistic spellcasting) and Wizards do it by mentalizing symbols (Symbolic spellcasting) that represent the microstructure of the molecules of the ethereal substances needed to create the spell.  Since this can be very complicated and unpractical, they usually need to detect patterns in the symbol creation and use basic spells to procedurally create these patterns, thus, assisting in the formation of the final spell (this is called Creation Metamagic). Thus, Idealistic spellcasting is straightforward for emotive mages, but is unstable, unprecise and uncertain. Symbolic spellcasting is complicated, requiring high intelligence, but it is more stable and precise, providing more control over the spells. <br>\t<strong>Druids </strong>are mages with a strong connection with nature and elemental spirits. Druid magic always resembles nature elements and is created with the assistance of elemental spirits that are followers of the druid.<br>\tThe <strong>Arganons </strong>are humans with supernatural abilities, usually (but not limited to) increased strength and physical resistance. They are bearers of an energy that can be channeled to enhance any attribute, including magic related ones. This is done by both meditation and exercising the attribute. For instance, an Arganon stimulating his intelligence, becomes more intelligent; stimulating strength, enhances strength. Arganons are believed to be born with this ability, although sometimes their power emerges only after they are adult. It is unknown what are the limits of the attribute-enhancement of Arganons.<br>\t<strong>Spirits </strong>are the inhabitants of the spiritual world. The spiritual world is made of ethereal substances that doesn\u2019t interact with the material plane substances, giving the illusion that they are on different spatial dimensions of reality. However, there are other substances that interact with both the material and spiritual worlds, consisting in a bridge of interaction between them. One such substance is called ectoplasm, and it is produced by organic creatures, but in a tiny amount. However, some creatures produce it in large amounts enough to provide an interaction between the planes, usually from the spiritual to the material and in the form of materialization of spirits. Usually, spirits that materialize are the ones with more attachment to the material plane. Elemental spirits are workers of the order of nature. Their affinity to their corresponding element makes them close enough to the material plane that they are able to partially influence their element without ectoplasm.", "about_the_game": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brief Description</h2><br>Elengard: Ascension focuses on the idea of self-improvement, power and... ascension!
