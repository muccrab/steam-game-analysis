The situation on the board can change very quickly and with it the balance of power. One mistake, one lapse of concentration and a player in the lead can suddenly find themselves losing. This is why individual games are often short and brutal, but also why a strong opening move(serve) is so important.<br />\r\nUZO has a steep, but short learning curve. The best way to learn is by observing how the computer plays and following the in-game message display. Full game rules are available at the press of a button, as is the history board showing the last 14 moves played at any stage of the game. The player is notified if repetitive play occurs and advised to change tactics to avoid an impasse(draw). <br />\r\nGames won are registered on a Tug-O-War score board.

Game performance is recorded and displayed only for the duration of a session so players don't get bogged down with scores. Game sessions are open-ended, which means any number of matches can be played at the player's convenience. <br />\r\nMost players will be able to beat the AI, but it does of course require practice. <br />\r\nFree updates in terms of AI and new skins will be forthcoming.
